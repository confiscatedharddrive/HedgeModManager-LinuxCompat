## So how do I use this?
It's simple, just grab the [latest version from GitHub](https://github.com/confiscatedharddrive/HedgeModManager-LinuxCompat/releases/latest) then extract all the files to where your game's .exe is.

## How do I install mods?
Due to not using a GUI, mods will need to be manually installed and defined in your `cpkredir.ini` and `ModsDB.ini` files. You can check the README included in the release, or [refer to the wiki](https://github.com/confiscatedharddrive/HedgeModManager-LinuxCompat/wiki/Mod-Installation-Guide-(Sonic-Origins)) on this repo.
